# Electric Emergency and Disturbance Dashboard - Portfolio Project

## Purpose

This project, the "Electric Emergency and Disturbance Dashboard," was undertaken as a personal initiative to showcase my skills and abilities as a Full Stack Developer. It serves as a tangible demonstration of my proficiency across the entire development lifecycle, from conceptualization and backend API design to frontend implementation and user interface development.

Beyond the functional application itself, this project aims to highlight:

* **Full Stack Capabilities:** My ability to design, develop, and integrate both the backend and frontend components of a web application.
* **Documentation Style:** My approach to creating clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation, as exemplified in this README and the accompanying project scope.
* **Reasoning and Decision-Making:** The rationale behind the architectural choices, technology selections, and implementation details within the project.
* **Workflow and Development Process:** A glimpse into my structured approach to development, including planning, implementation, and attention to detail.

## Project Overview

The Electric Emergency and Disturbance Dashboard is a full-stack application designed to visualize and analyze electric outage data. Inspired by the concept of a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system, it takes raw data (simulated through a JSON file) and presents it in a meaningful and insightful way to highlight trends and impacts.

The application consists of the following key components:

* **Backend:** A Node.js powered API responsible for reading and serving the outage data from a JSON file. It also includes Swagger UI for API documentation and testing.
* **Frontend:** A user-friendly and modular interface built with Vue.js and Bootstrap. It utilizes Graph.js to create interactive visualizations of the outage data.

## Key Features Demonstrated

This project demonstrates my ability to:

* **Design and implement a RESTful API using Node.js.**
* **Work with JSON data structures and file-based data storage.**
* **Utilize API documentation tools like Swagger UI.**
* **Develop a reactive and component-based user interface using Vue.js.**
* **Implement responsive design principles with Bootstrap.**
* **Integrate data visualization libraries like Graph.js to create meaningful charts.**
* **Understand and implement project scoping and documentation practices.**

## Intended Audience

This project and its accompanying documentation are primarily intended for:

* **Prospective employers and collaborators:** To evaluate my technical skills, development approach, and communication abilities.
* **Anyone interested in understanding the development process of a full-stack web application.**

## Further Exploration

The project scope outlines the specific features and functionalities implemented. Reviewing the codebase, the project scope document, and this README will provide a comprehensive understanding of my development process and the resulting application.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project!
