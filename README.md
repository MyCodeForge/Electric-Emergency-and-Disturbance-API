#   Electric Emergency and Disturbance Dashboard - Portfolio Project (Backend Focus)

##   Purpose

   This project, the "Electric Emergency and Disturbance Dashboard," was undertaken as a personal initiative to showcase my skills and abilities in **Backend Development**. It serves as a tangible demonstration of my proficiency in designing and developing server-side logic and APIs.

   Beyond the functional application itself, this project aims to highlight:

   * **Backend Capabilities:** My ability to design, develop, and manage the backend components of a web application.
   * **Documentation Style:** My approach to creating clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation, as exemplified in this README and the accompanying project scope.
   * **Reasoning and Decision-Making (Backend):** The rationale behind the architectural choices, technology selections, and implementation details for the server-side logic and API.
   * **Workflow and Development Process (Backend):** A glimpse into my structured approach to backend development, including planning, implementation, and attention to detail in data handling and API design.

##   Project Overview (Backend)

   The Electric Emergency and Disturbance Dashboard includes a robust backend API built with Node.js. This API is responsible for efficiently managing and serving electric outage data. It utilizes a JSON file as the data source and provides endpoints for accessing and retrieving this information. To enhance usability and development workflows, the backend also incorporates Swagger UI for interactive API documentation and testing.

   The key components of the **backend** application include:

   * **Backend:** A Node.js powered API responsible for reading and serving the outage data from a JSON file. It also includes Swagger UI for API documentation and testing.

##   Key Features Demonstrated (Backend)

   This project demonstrates my ability to:

   * **Design and implement a RESTful API using Node.js.**
   * **Work with JSON data structures and file-based data storage.**
   * **Utilize API documentation tools like Swagger UI.**
   * **Handle data retrieval and delivery efficiently.**
   * **Understand and implement project scoping and documentation practices (specifically for the backend).**

##   Intended Audience

   This project and its accompanying documentation are primarily intended for:

   * **Prospective employers and collaborators:** To evaluate my technical skills in backend development, my approach to API design, and my communication abilities.
   * **Anyone interested in understanding the development process of a data-driven web API using Node.js.**

##   Further Exploration

   The project scope outlines the specific features and functionalities implemented in the backend. Reviewing the codebase, the project scope document, and this README will provide a comprehensive understanding of my backend development process and the resulting API.

   Thank you for taking the time to explore this project!
